This program was built by me, Nimrod Rappaport with the help of Daniel Kaufman and Eithan Hartal with testing the game.
This was built for fun and as a programming excercise for myself.
Priority: finding a way to make a dmt file
working on: resizing

This program currently stabely supports:
Midddle clicking, 1st click empty, showing flagged bombs at the end of games.

This program is testing:
None.

I hope you enjoy,
Nimrod Rappaport.
